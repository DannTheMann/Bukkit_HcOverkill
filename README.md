# HcOverkill

- Very old plugin, about 1 year and a half old. 
- Coding style completely different.
- Very ugly to look at from my POV, maybe others.

This plugin was used on HcOverkill, around 1 year prior to it's shut down. 
It contained most commands that were seen as 'unique' however it didn't have all the plugins that featured on
the server, as many of those were developed separately.
